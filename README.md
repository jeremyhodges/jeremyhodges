## Career Background


## Life Outside of Work

I'm married to my middle school sweetheart, Tiffany. We took the long way to find a life together and have a combined household of five children: three from my first marriage and two from hers. Our children range from ages 15 to 9. Four different schools in two different towns and a schedule that keeps us all on our toes!

We all absolutley love the water. During the summer you'll often find us on the lake wake surfing, knee boarding, and wake boarding. We try to get to the beach several times a year so the kids can boogie board and the parents can get fried in the sun. During the winter you might find us off-roading in our side-by-sides, but mostly talking about getting back to the water in the summer.

We live in a little town in the middle of nowhere. We currently have 2 dogs, 2 rabbits, 3 guinea pigs, 6 ducks, and too many chickens to count. You'll often hear them in the background if I'm on the phone and walking around the property. I love animals and believe they help keep us grounded and connected to the world around us. I am always looking for ways to make our property more self-sustaining.
