## Communication

### Email

First, I believe heavily in [Inbox Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk). Early in my career I worked at a webhosting company where a very small team supported several thousand clients. We lived in our email nearly all day every day and an organized email system I believe is as critical to the modern technology team as an organized filing system is to a CPA.

Email I believe should be used for more long-form and formal communication. Unlike my early days, now there are much better forms of cummunication for items that require a quick response. I will typically respond to email within 24-hours, if nothing else to let you know I have it and provide an update when you can expect a detailed response. If you don't get a response from me within that time, don't hesitate to follow-up. I rarely completely miss an email, but it has been known to happen.

### Text Messges

This is the best way to get a hold of me on the weekends or after-hours. My door is always open and this is the most personal way to reach out to me. I do not turn-on Slack notifications on my phone. This is part of my work-life balanance. Others may find it easier to keep the balance by taking the oppostive approach.

### Slack

An instant messaging solution is critical to any remote team--with that said, proper etique is still important. For many, Slack\Teams\Discord\etc., are like walking up to your desk\office. Private\direct messages to me are a knock on the door rather than a "you must respond to this now." Teams should use @here and @channel only when appropriate. Formal communication I prefer to be in email. I will often hold long, passive conversations throughout a day on Slack. I never expect an instant response, but always appreciate the heads up if you're busy or stepping away in the middle of a conversation.

### Telephone \ Zoom

I am always up for a good voice-to-voice conversation. Particuarlly in today's remote working world, I like to hear the voices of my co-workers and take time to walk away from the computer to talk through things. I do however generally "plan" or "schedule" this type of communication. Often I will text, ping, email, or send a calendar invite. The best way to get "face-to-face" time with me is to do the same.

## Developer Experience

> "If you don't love it, you're going to fail." â€” Steve Jobs

Life is too short to deal with [toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/). Programming should be enjoyable a majority of the time. The tools should serve you and get out of the way. I believe heavily in automation and a strong DevOps culture. If something is getting in your way or causing discomfort, whether that be tools, environments, or processes, please let me know! 

## Career Background

I started my career as a [classic-ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) web developer and eventually migrated to .NET 2.0. I built several e-commerce, CRM, and process managment systems for small to mid-sized businesses in the late '90s and early 2000s. In the early days, all the sites were hosted on a server under my desk with dual-ISDN lines. I later went to work for a Microsoft Gold Certified web hosting provider, ORCS Web. We were known for being the most technically compotent Microsoft hosting provider at the time. We hosted many of Microsoft's own technical sites, such as ASP.NET, WEBLOGS.ASP.NET, IIS.NET, and others. This is before the days of Azure and most of Microsoft's internal teams much prefered working with us vs the Microsoft.com team. Our company was made up of 95% software engineers and we built our business on the philosophy of building [Raving Fans](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00I61QNBU/)--a principal I still carey within me in everything I do.

## Life Outside of Work

I'm married to my middle school sweetheart, Tiffany. We took the long way to find a life together and have a combined household of five children: three from my first marriage and two from hers. Our children range from ages 15 to 9. Four different schools in two different towns and a schedule that keeps us all on our toes!

We all absolutley love the water. During the summer you'll often find us on the lake wake surfing, knee boarding, and wake boarding. We try to get to the beach several times a year so the kids can boogie board and the parents can get fried in the sun. During the winter you might find us off-roading in our side-by-sides, but mostly talking about getting back to the water in the summer.

We live in a little town in the middle of nowhere. We currently have 2 dogs, 2 rabbits, 3 guinea pigs, 6 ducks, and too many chickens to count. You'll often hear them in the background if I'm on the phone and walking around the property. I love animals and believe they help keep us grounded and connected to the world around us. I am always looking for ways to make our property more self-sustaining.
