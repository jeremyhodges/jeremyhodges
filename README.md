## Engineering Leadership

First and foremost, my role is to help my team be successful. There are organizational objectives that we all have to guide towards, but helping my team will not move from my top focus. Some of the things you can expect from me:

- Providing clear vision and direction for their work
- Providing regular feedback on them and their work
- Help them plan their career
- Help them grow as an engineer, teammate, manager (where applicable), and person
- Regular 1x1s
- Gathering feedback from them on our team, tools and processes

### Human First

Before our jobs, careers, companies and passions we are above all else human. I will always strive to keep that front and center in everything I do and every decision I make. Holding this true ensures I keep empathy at the core, leave space for mistakes, and don't avoid the difficult topics just because we are in the work place.

### Question Everything and Learn Continuously

I love answering questions. I am not usually the loudest person in the room or the most outspoken, but put a tremendous amount of thought and energy into everything I do. With that said, I don't always get it right or have the full perspective on things. I love when teammates come to me with questions and genuinely want to learn and help drive to the absolute best outcome possible.

You should never stop learning and never let me either. Hold me accountable if you don't feel I am understanding the problem at hand or am missing context. Teach me from your experience. No two humans are alike and we always have an opportunity to foster new things in one another.

### Open Door

Even in this remote world, know my "door is always open." You aren't bothering me. I am here to serve you and ensure as a team we get the most out of all the pieces. Depending on topic and availability, from time-to-time I may ask if we can discuss a topic further at another time. If you ever feel I am not putting the right priority on something you are bringing me, please let me know.

### Disagree Openly

If you disagree on an issue, explain why you disagree, ideally in both discussion and in writing. The back and forth of discussion can clarify the different views, and concise writing of the core issues helps people reflect on what is the wise course. Writing also makes it easy to share your views widely. My commitment to you is to welcome, understand, and consider your opinions, but may not always agree. Silent disagreement is unproductive.

### Engineering is Customer Service

At the end of the day, we are here to build something for someone. We serve at the pleasure of our customers. I will always strive to build systems that are easier to use, easier to maintain, resilient and reliable.

## Communication

### Email

First, I believe strongly in [Inbox Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk). Early in my career I worked at a webhosting company where a very small team supported several thousand clients. We lived in our email nearly all day every day and an organized email system I believe is as critical to the modern technology team as an organized filing system is to a CPA.

Email I believe should be used for more long-form and formal communication. Unlike my early days, now there are much better forms of communication for items that require a quick response. I will typically respond to email within 24-hours, if nothing else to let you know I have it and provide an update when you can expect a detailed response. If you don't get a response from me within that time, don't hesitate to follow-up. I rarely completely miss an email, but it has been known to happen.

### Text Messages

This is the best way to get a hold of me on the weekends or after-hours. My door is always open and this is the most personal way to reach out to me. I do not turn-on Slack notifications on my phone. This is part of my work-life balance. Others may find it easier to keep the balance by taking the opposite approach.

### Slack

An instant messaging solution is critical to any remote team--with that said, proper etique is still important. For many, Slack\Teams\Discord\etc., are like walking up to your desk\office. Private\direct messages to me are a knock on the door rather than a "you must respond to this now." Teams should use @here and @channel only when appropriate. Formal communication I prefer to be in email. I will often hold long, passive conversations throughout a day on Slack. I never expect an instant response, but always appreciate the heads up if you're busy or stepping away in the middle of a conversation.

### Telephone \ Zoom

I am always up for a good voice-to-voice conversation. Particularly in today's remote working world, I like to hear the voices of my co-workers and take time to walk away from the computer to talk through things. I do however generally "plan" or "schedule" this type of communication. Often I will text, ping, email, or send a calendar invite. The best way to get "face-to-face" time with me is to do the same.

## Developer Experience

> "If you don't love it, you're going to fail." — Steve Jobs

Life is too short to deal with [toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/). Programming should be enjoyable a majority of the time. The tools should serve you and get out of the way. I believe heavily in automation and a strong DevOps culture. If something is getting in your way or causing discomfort, whether that be tools, environments, or processes, please let me know! 

## Career Background

I started my career as a [classic-ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) web developer and eventually migrated to .NET 2.0. I built several e-commerce, CRM, and process management systems for small to midsize businesses in the late '90s and early 2000s. In the early days, all the sites were hosted on a server under my desk with dual-ISDN lines. I later went to work for a Microsoft Gold Certified web hosting provider, ORCS Web. We were known for being the most technically competent Microsoft hosting provider at the time. We hosted many of Microsoft's own technical sites, such as ASP.NET, WEBLOGS.ASP.NET, IIS.NET, and others.

We even had the opportunity to work with MSNBC on the first ever streamed Olympics. Microsoft was developing Silverlight at the time and we solutioned and provided a backend platform for most of the player analytics. This is before the days of Azure and most of Microsoft's internal teams much prefered working with us vs the Microsoft.com team. Our company was made up of 95% software engineers and we built our business on the philosophy of building [Raving Fans](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00I61QNBU/)--a principal I still carey within me in everything I do.

Next I gave the startup thing a shot. I bootstrapped a concept I called "just in time digital media production." It was a platform for Fortune 500 companies to quickly get independent/freelance artists, directors, etc. to produce media content for their products. I was fortunate enough to land Lowe's Home Improvement as a client and have over 150 projects run through our platform. Unfortunately, sales and building a client-base were not my strength and I eventually found I did not have a sustainable business. During this time period I had often been asked to consult with Lowe's, Belk, and others to help guide major e-commerce and OmniChannel direction and decisions.

In 2015, I found myself needing to go back into the workforce. My co-founder and I shutdown the company and I went to work for an [e-commerce company in SC](https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/). It was an intimate and fast-paced environment. I found myself back in the early days of my career: renegotiating unfavorable contracts, identifying vendor tools that could quickly increase revenue, and rewriting their e-commerce platform, CRM, and inventory management system. The company was already heavily invested in the LAMP stack and had quickly grown into the tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue. My primary job was to prepare their technical stack and processes for an acquisition in the hundreds of millions.

If you know the Charlotte, NC area at all, you know we are primarily known as the banking hub of the south--thanks to Bank of America, Wells Fargo, BB&T/SunTrust/Truist, Ally, and others. While I had always sworn off the banks, I eventually got a call and an offer that would have been difficult for me to turn down. There was a team working on BankOfAmerica.com that was focused on modern technologies and trying to build the capabilities within the bank of a modern technology team. I spent the next 2 1/2 years focused almost entirely in JavaScript and MarTech integrations, eventually running an engineering team that was focused on entirely revitalizing the bank's digital data collection stack. A platform designed to collect over 2.25 billion customer interactions per month.

In 2018 I was recruited to Ally Financial by a Sr. Director of Engineering I have tremendous respect for. I had the opportunity to step into Ally with no real designated role and help find areas within the growing engineering department I could best add value to. Within a few months I found myself building a DevOps Engineering team, trying to improve the overall developer experience within the bank, and removing as many manual processes as I could. Let's be honest, in 2018 developers shouldn't be sending zip files and multipage release notes to an operations team. Within the next two years I had grown to an engineering team of 35 with 4 engineering managers, introduced the practice of Site Reliability Engineering to Ally, and jump started our teams' journey into AWS.

Within the midst of a pandemic, in May of 2021 I joined a NYC based FinTech called [CommonBond](https://commonbond.co) as VP of Engineering--a role that included IT, Infrastrucutre, Data Engineering & Software Engineering. Attrition within the tech team was high, morale was low, and they were having difficulty getting quality work out the door. In the months to follow, I had the opportunity to help stabilize and reinvigorate the team. An intense effort was made immedietly to double down on recruiting efforts and promote strong talent already within the team. A new team structure and opperating model was introduced to optimize the skillsets and start to bring joy back into the organization. Teams were empowered to own their code from development to production with an emphasis on quality over quantity. As a team, we started to shift-left and embrace a DevOps culture with an emphasis on agility instead of Agile. After just 8-mo, I was honored to be promoted to CTO and have the product and product team added to my responsibilities.

In 2022, I joined as CTO of [Live Oak Bank](https://liveoak.bank).

So far, it's been a fantastic ride.

## Life Outside of Work

I was born in a [little tiny town in Southern CA](https://goo.gl/maps/mbDWbjmLFbHnZvUt5), but moved to North Carolina as a teenager. I still love CA and try to visit as often as I can. My home is certainly North Carolina, but a piece of me will always remain in CA.

I'm married to my middle school sweetheart, Tiffany. We took the long way to find a life together and have a combined household of five children: three from my first marriage and two from hers. Our children range from ages 17 to 11. It certainly keeps us all on our toes!

We all absolutely love the water. During the summer you'll often find us on the lake wake surfing, knee boarding, and wakeboarding. We try to get to the beach several times a year so the kids can boogie board and the parents can get fried in the sun. During the winter you might find us off-roading in our side-by-sides, but mostly talking about getting back to the water in the summer.

We live in a little town in the middle of nowhere. We currently have 4 dogs, a rabbit, a guinea pigs, and a bearded dragon. You'll often hear them in the background if I'm on the phone and walking around the property. I love animals and believe they help keep us grounded and connected to the world around us. My wife will tell you, I always have two or three projects going at any given time. There's always a pond to build, a wall to construct or a room that needs renovated.
